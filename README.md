# Welcome to Juno
<p>This is a repository of the files I use for my daily driver laptop. The aim for this build is simply usability and ease of access. Also, I hate using my trackpad. This is meant for speed and efficiency, without bloat and very low battery consumption. I use this for work and daily use. <p>

  
  <p>I am running a Fedora system with Workstation 42, and Hyprland. Certain dependencies can be substituted, however alternatives for my build will not be discussed here. I take ownership of all the code presented, however I have taken a lot of inspiration from other authors. This is simply a conglomeration of different ideas that have been Frankenstein'ed into my daily driver. </p>

  
  It's called Juno because it's cool.
  

# Installation Guide
  First of all, this is Fedora, so fedora commands. `sudo` and `dnf` are your friend. I would recommend keeping a very simple, lightweight desktop enviornment as a backup just in case. If it easier for you to navigate in a GUI based WM, the option is there for you with Gnome Desktop or KDE. This guide is going based off the philosophy of designing a secure, reliable, and fast desktop enviornment for everyday use. 

## Requirements
- Hyprland
- Hyprlock
- Hyprshot
- btop
- htop
- copyq
- Dunst
- Waybar
- Wofi
- feh
- swaybg
### Optional
- cava
- wallust
- cmatrix
- Spotify
- Plex
- fastfetch

##### To install dependencies, use the command;

```
sudo dnf install hyprland hyprlock hyprshot dunst waybar wofi rofi feh swaybg btop htop copyq
```

##### and for optional dependencies;

```
sudo dnf install cmatrix cava fastfetch wallust
```

Installing Plex or Spotify are largely optional. This may be updated in the future when I get around to/learn theming those in a way that is appealing. However, you can install them at your leisure. 

This was built in inspiration of and largely based on [JaKooLit's Hyprland Dots](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots), and [Nordic](https://github.com/EliverLara/Nordic) by Eliver Lara.

<p> Peace. <p>
